The final code used the difference of Gaussians instead of a an inverted Gaussian function to give a more positive bias
at the edges. Two parameters, A and sigma, must be kept constant while varying epsilon to change synchronism, and a minor 
increase in rad can help achieve synch.

The controller has added another 'proportional feedback' along with the earlier integral. Ida multiplier and error 
multiplier is expected to be kept at smaller values. 

Epsilon is not subtracted in the weights calculation, as done previously, but multiplied instead.
