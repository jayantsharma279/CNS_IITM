The codes are written in MATLAB as an implementation of the study done by V.S. Chakravarthy et al. [1] of the handwriting analysis of Parkinson's patients by computing a model of the Basal Ganglia. Parameters like Dopamine (DA), parameter spacing (rad), and epsilon (positive bias) are controlled to obtain the final graph. 

The work is expected to show the increase in synchronization of the neuron spiking as DA values are decreased, representing Parkinsonian conditions and vice-versa. 

Files sim_stn_gpe executes the other files attached as functions called within the initial file. Parameters can be altered through the same file as well.
