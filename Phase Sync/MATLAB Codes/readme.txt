Modification of the program written by Mr. Umesh Prajapati (see license file attached). The existing code was used to plot thr Rossler and Lorenz System. The paper by Rosenblum et al. [1] was majorly referenced and a MATLAB program was developed to simulate the conditions.

Furthermore, forced synchronization of the Rossler attractor is implemented by an external force of amplitude "E", over variable values of angular frequency Omega. Final result shown in the plot.
